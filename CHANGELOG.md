# Changelog

Every version becomes a release on GitHub; the section under the version is the text of that release.

## 0.10.0

First public release of Moss365, moved over from the internal version 0.9 (step R1, part A of the
[roadmap](docs/roadmap-1.0.md)).

- **Moss365 everywhere**: the program, projects and namespaces (`Moss365.Core`, `Moss365.Connections`, `Moss365.UI`,
  `Moss365.Desktop`), the data folder `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Moss365` and the default name of the app registration.
- **Migrating an existing installation**: at the first start the app looks for a previous installation in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%` (recognised by its database and organisation settings) and copies it. The old folder stays until you
  remove it.
- **No organisation-specific content**: the sample configuration is a made-up organisation (Contoso), group rules of
  one organisation were removed, test data uses example domains.
- **Script library**: the first generic script (`scripts/FileServer/Remove-OfficeLockFiles.ps1`); more follow in R8.
- **Repository**: EUPL-1.2, contributor licence agreement, security policy, privacy check, CodeQL, Dependabot, and
  releases with a SHA-256 fingerprint (`SHA256SUMS.txt`).

Still in Dutch: names in the code and the interface. The code moves to English in 0.11 (R1, part B); the interface gets
dictionaries in five languages in R15.

The download is not signed yet (signing starts at 1.0): Windows SmartScreen will warn. Verify the download with
`SHA256SUMS.txt`.
